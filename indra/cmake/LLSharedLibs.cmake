  # It's not clear that this does anything useful for us on Darwin. It has

  # produces ominous spammy warnings: at the time the command below is run, we
  # have not yet populated the nested mac-crash-logger.app/Contents/Resources
  # with the .dylibs with which it was linked. Moreover, the form of the
  # embedded @executable_path/../Resources/mumble.dylib pathname confuses the
  # GetPrerequisites.cmake tool invoked by DeploySharedLibs.cmake. It seems
  # clear that we have long since accomplished by other means what this was
  # originally supposed to do. Skipping it only eliminates an annoying
  # non-fatal error.
